## Sample Analyses

### 1. Loan Volume Over Time  
Bar charts illustrating how loan purchases have trended from 2004 through the most recent year. This helps assess the impact of macroeconomic events (e.g., 2008 housing crisis, COVID-19) on affordable lending.

### 2. County-Level Loan Trends  
Analysis of total loans purchased and average loan amounts by county to identify:
- High-demand housing markets
- Under-served geographies
- Regional disparities in loan amounts or program utilization

### 3. DPAL/CCAL Program Utilization  
Annual percentage of loans that included down payment or closing cost assistance. Used to track how often these affordability tools are used and where they are most needed.

### 4. Borrower Profile Exploration  
Insights into:
- Average household size
- Loan-to-value ratios by property type
- Distribution of loan types (FHA vs. Conventional)
- Prevalence of single-family vs. multi-unit properties
